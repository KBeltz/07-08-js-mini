# 07-08-js-mini

This set of exercises contains common interactions that you would actually build as a web developer.

Work in pairs (not in threes, and not individually). Switch whose computer you're using every 22 minutes. You can do them in any order you like.

Set your goal to be completing at least 3 of them by the end of the day. This will also be an exercise in focus – it's not speed that will help you finish these as much as it's the ability to ignore distractions and rabbit-holes along the way. Take the simplest path to completion.

Put all of the mini-exercises in their own folder, but keep all of the folders within a single project folder. So:

~/Code/
07-08-javascript-mini-exercises/
tabs/
barcamp-mobile-nav/
accordion/
modal-window/
auto-tab-phone-number/
sticky-shrinking-header/
With all of the below tasks, the screen recording is meant to serve as a guide (except for the Barcamp Mobile Nav one). Don't get caught up on the minor details of the style and/or effect. Focus on the spirit of the interaction (e.g. with the Accordion task, the important part is that clicking a header reveals content below it - not that the headers have a black background and white text).

##Tabs

##Barcamp Mobile Nav

Build this: http://cl.ly/btKY

First copy one of your Barcamp files into a subfolder in this project. That way your mini-exercises are collected in one place – it's easier for you to find later as well as for me to review them all together.

##Accordion

Build this: http://cl.ly/btGs

##Modal Window

Build this: http://cl.ly/btRR

Again, focus on the spirit of the interaction. What's important is that clicking a link reveals a modal window - not that the modal window contains a form which is styled in a certain way.

##Auto Tab Phone Number

Build this: http://cl.ly/bszg

What's not obvious from the recording is that the focus automatically shifts from one field to the next when three digits have been added. It saves the user from having to tab over to the next field.

##Sticky Shrinking Header

Build this: http://cl.ly/btHc

Notice that the header doesn't scroll with the rest of the page. Also, the header shrinks after the user has scrolled to a certain point.
